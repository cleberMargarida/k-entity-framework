# Architecture

Understanding the architecture of K.EntityFrameworkCore will help you make the most of its capabilities and design your applications effectively.

## Core Concepts

This section covers the fundamental architectural concepts:

- **[Middleware Architecture](middleware-architecture.md)** - How the middleware pipeline works
- **[Plugin Serialization](plugin-serialization.md)** - Extensible serialization system
- **[Service Attributes](service-attributes.md)** - Service registration and dependency injection

## Design Principles

K.EntityFrameworkCore is built on several key design principles:

- **Modularity** - Components are designed to work independently
- **Extensibility** - Easy to extend and customize behavior
- **Performance** - Optimized for high-throughput scenarios
- **Reliability** - Built-in patterns for message delivery guarantees

## Next Steps

After understanding the architecture, explore the [Features](../features/index.md) section to see these concepts in action, or check out the [Guides](../guides/index.md) for configuration and best practices.
